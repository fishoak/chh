Newman--and his wife Marion wanted a smaller house than those Charles had grown up in, recognizing that they could not afford the wealthy lifestyle of his parents. Times were changing; the Depression was coming. Marion would do much of the housework, so theirs was reputedly the first village house built without a maid's room. 
 
 Jared Newman was much impressed with his son and daughter-in-law's home, designed by Ithaca architect LeRoy Burnham, so much so that he turned his attention to the building of smaller homes a bit farther north in the Village from the original section where his own grand house stood at the intersection of Highland Road and The Parkway. Smaller and cheaper housing, he hoped, would not mean ""Cheap John"" designs; his solution was the development he called Klinewoods, beginning in 1932.

As Newman intended, the central location added to the attraction of Cayuga Heights for families with children. Named for its beloved first principal, Miss Martha Hitchcock, Hitchcock Hall was the forerunner of the Cayuga Heights Elementary School. It was a beautiful, rambling Tudor-style building in a park-like setting. Sadly, the era of urban renewal brought its demolition and replacement by the Ithaca City School District in 1968 with the current, much more generic building, which has been added on to since. 
 
 In 1980, enrollment decline caused the Ithaca City School District to close the school. Disappointed villagers responded with the formation of a Cayuga Heights Community Association under the leadership of Betty Matyas, who lived next door to the school. Tenants were found, including a Montessori school, to keep the building viable, and when enrollments climbed back up, the school was reopened in 1988 for both village children and those bussed from West Hill. In 1995, the large number of older adults who sold their homes and moved to Kendal at Ithaca flooded the real estate market with houses that young families proved eager to purchase, and so, once again the school was bursting at the seams.

Though built during the Great Depression, the house is so solid, it still retains its structural integrity, and was built with extra thick walls. While millions lost their jobs and their money in the Crash, Cornell faculty salaries were cut only 6-10%, leaving them with the means to hire the available labor to continue to build comfortable homes. 
 
 Initially, garages in the Heights were required to face away from the street, however, people often did not even have a car. Since that time, most garages have been changed to face the street, and many have been expanded to fit two cars and now, recycling bins. 
 
 Of living in this area in the 1930s, Marcham writes in his account, ""Memories of Cayuga Heights, N.Y.,"" of a ""typical Cayuga Heights Street"": ""My wife and I had chosen a place in Oak Hill Road that would allow our children a half mile walk to school and give me a one mile walk to the Cornell campus. For the walk I had friends; two of my neighbors joined me in walking, and one of them, like myself, owned no car....Their wives walked down Oak Hill Road westward to Highland Road and then south to the bus stop on Thurston Avenue. For a time, in the 1930s, milkmen and men who delivered ice, and the leading grocers in Ithaca, allowed us to order goods and brought them to us and to other persons around the City of Ithaca. If you were sick you would not go to the doctor; he or she came to you, the doctor with the little black bag. And once or twice a year the coalman came and poured tons of coal down a chute into your cellar.""

The earliest section of the home, its northern wing (1817), was constructed by Isaac Cradit. It possesses many Greek Revival characteristics such as pilasters, a cornice line with full entablature, a pediment-shaped door surround and elaborate window molding. 
 
 Around 1860-61, the southern wing was added when it was sold to Peter Kline, who owned much farmland in the area. 
 The house was bought by Dr. and Mrs. Norman Moore in 1938 and underwent many changes. Dr. Moore was the first Director of Cornell University’s health care system. In 1948 the house was sold to Cornell with the Moores retaining lifetime residency.
 
 About fifteen years ago, Cornell’s expansion blueprint for the North Campus included plans to demolish the building, and Historic Ithaca stepped in to save the almost 200-year-old structure. In 2000, the house was moved about three-tenths of a mile north of its original location at 128 Pleasant Grove Road to its current location.

After Franklin Sherman Peer's death in 1922, his wife Harriet lived in the home with their son Sherman Peer, his wife Eleanor, and their two children. Sherman was an Ithaca lawyer active in village social and political affairs. He was best man for his friend Robert E. Treman, who married actress Irene Castle. The Tremans settled nearby at Greystone. Sherman, a 1906 Cornell grad, later served as Cornell provost for external affairs. 
 
 The original address of the Peer home was 401 Highland Road but later became known as 2 Parkway Place. It was the first Stickley home in Ithaca and clearly reflects the Craftsman style of architecture. It is one of three grand residences marking The Parkway and Highland Road corner at the entrance to Cayuga Heights, the other two being the house built by Jared Newman at 9 Parkway Place and 104 The Parkway, built by J.H. Tanner, the Village's first treasurer (see a photograph taken of the three homes in about 1916 in former village historian Carol Sisler's book, Enterprising Families). In 1949, Sherman Peer sold 2 Parkway Place to James and Diana Rothschild, who owned the popular Rothschild's Department Store downtown on the Ithaca Commons from the turn of the century until 1980.

As narrated by John Marcham, (see 112 Oak Hill Road), an active member in the 1950s, Charles was inspired to found the troop when he pulled aside Lord Baden Powell, the founder of Boy Scouting, for conversation during a visit the latter made to the Delta Upsilon fraternity house at Cornell in the company of Theodore Roosevelt. 
 
 In 1917, Scoutmaster Newman was called to serve in World War I and was replaced by a Cornell Heights neighbor, the renowned artist and naturalist Fuertes. With ready access to Cornell faculty and Fuertes as guide, the troop focused on nature study and took part in  such wartime efforts as selling savings stamps, Liberty Loan Drives, and the County War Chest.

 In 1958, Kirkpatrick Sale, who grew up at 309 The Parkway and went on to become a prolific author on environmentalism, politics, and other subjects, was a leader of a Cornell student protest outside the Malott's home. At issue was a university policy forbidding unchaperoned parties in off-campus housing, which the protestors thought was the ""last straw"" in attempted control over student life. Sale and his Cornell roommate, Richard Fariña, who fictionalized the era in his 1966 novel, Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, were part of the protest. Fariña's friend, Thomas Pynchon, described the scene at the house in the foreword to a later edition of the book. Such events as these set the stage, of course, for the much more serious student radicalism to come and were likely an impetus to move the next Cornell president farther north in the Village, away from the campus boundary.

She and her husband Luther Libby (1882-1941) ran a farm in Caroline for many years. Between the 1930s and until she sold the property in 1953, Libby rented out rooms in the house at 206 Overlook. She also seems to have supplemented her income during the Depression by working out of the home as a “corsetiere,” or corset maker. Notable residents of the home include scientific illustrator Elizabeth Burckmyer and artist Christian Midjo. Burckmyer illustrated Liberty Hyde Bailey's ""Garden of the Bellflowers,"" among many other works. One of Midjo's paintings can be seen at Marcham Hall.

The Manning Farm fell within lot 89 in the Township of Ulysses, the predecessor of the Town of Ithaca. After Richard's death, his wife Lydia Manning transferred part of her property to her daughter Amanda and son-in-law Elijah Labar for $300 in 1845. The deed stipulated that Lydia would receive $20 a year during her lifetime from the Labars. This is most likely the Labar house that farm neighbor Carrie Manning mentions in the diary that she kept in the year 1869.
  
 Carrie notes almost daily visits at the Labar house. Just about every evening her Pa “went over” to see fellow farmer Elijah Labar. Carrie also wrote with concern that Leroy Labar, Elijah and his second wife Caroline’s son, who was just a year older than Carrie, had scarlet fever and that Elijah’s older daughter Lydia was sick.

According to former Cayuga Heights Village Historian Carol Sisler, the home was built sometime between 1810 and 1829.  It is a candidate for the oldest home in Cayuga Heights. 
The façade of the original part of the house is distinctively symmetrical, with two side-by-side front doors flanked by nine-over-six pane windows. It has a side gable that faces the road and a low-pitched roof with chimneys on each end of the house. A later addition extended the house to the west, maintaining the plain brick exterior but disrupting the Georgian symmetry. The foundation is brick, which is an atypical feature for Tompkins County, suggesting that the builder of the home drew on an architectural tradition from another region.
Beginning about 1811 the property was the “homestead” of Richard Manning (d. 1827) and Lydia Vaughan Manning (1778-1848). Richard Manning purchased 36 acres from Lydia’s father, Daniel Vaughan, a Revolutionary War veteran from Knowlton, New Jersey. The Mannings bought an additional 47 acres from William Kimple, also a Revolutionary War soldier from New Jersey.
Richard Manning died land-rich but in debt in 1827, and the estate was required to “sell or lease” some of the family’s 393 ½ acres to satisfy his debts. Lydia, however, remained living on the homestead farm “subject . . . to the widow’s right of dower in her lifetime.”  Richard and Lydia’s son, Daniel Van Manning, is shown as occupying the property on Tompkins County maps dated 1853 and 1866. 
The property passed down through several generations of the Manning family until it was sold to Elmer Savage (1884-1943) and Genevieve Savage in 1920. Elmer Savage was a Cornell professor of Animal Husbandry who was internationally known for developing feed standards for dairy cows. He operated a dairy farm on the former Manning farm and bred Guernsey cows. 
Cornell University purchased the lot in 1968, and in 1994 the Kendal retirement community bought the property. It is currently rented out to Kendal residents as a private home, with Kendal’s wine-making club using the basement.

Intended for fitness and sport for the leisured class, it was a hastily built structure. The small building was sold for financial reasons, and the Sheldons, who owned the former Bush farm, purchased it for son Ralph Sheldon and his wife Emily and their family. 
 
Cut in half with hand saws, this house was transported up Triphammer Road to number 901. Mrs. Sheldon was widowed after her husband died treating patients with influenza after World War I. So when someone wanted to buy the Triphammer property, she happily hired a tractor to move the house to East Upland Road, though it got stuck in the neighbor's mud on the way!

In 1933, Martin and Louise Catherwood purchased a large lot at the end of Highgate Road from Jared T. Newman and Jane E.W. Newman. The Catherwoods bought the ""Morrell Mansion"" and had it taken apart, moved, and rebuilt on their Highgate Road property. After the Highgate Section became a part of the Village of Cayuga Heights, Louise Catherwood, who had taught in Cornell's College of Home Economics, served as the first female trustee on the village board, from 1956 to 1959.

A flat roof and natural lighting provided by clerestory windows provide a strong visual connection between the interior and exterior spaces. Designed and owned by Cornell architecture professor Alexander Kira, the home adheres to Miesian design principles. This minimalist aesthetic was evident in the two homes he designed for himself in Cayuga Heights (the other has since been replaced). Those who had occasion to visit recalled that he and his wife, Marian, were always proud to show off the many special features of these houses. Storage compartments were designed to accommodate specific items such as wine glasses, placemats, or socks. The interiors were always comfortable, clean, properly arranged and camera ready.

Renamed in 1944 for the house that Soames Forsyte built for beautiful Irene in The Forsyte Saga, Robin Hill was originally known as Thorn Hill, and architect J. Lakin Baldridge designed and built it for his family. In 1944, the Baldridges sold the mansion to Robert E. and Carolyn S. Treman, who bestowed the current name on the home. In 1963, the university purchased the house, and Cornell President James Perkins and family moved in. The change of the president's residence from 205 Oak Hill Road may have been occasioned by the university administration's wish to move farther from campus, out of easy reach by students, given an incident at the 205 Oak Hill address in 1958.
 
 The half-timbered house is built of locally quarried Llenroc (Cornell spelled backwards) stone and stucco, with leaded glass windows, large and small slate roof tiles, and copper water pipes, indicating the high-quality standards used. A monument to the pre-Depression era, the house boasts 9,000 square feet, has seventeen rooms, nine fireplaces, eight bathrooms, and closets as large as entire rooms.

For the garden, Norwegian-born Audhild Sanne designed a ""Little Europe"" of stone bridges and castles in the backyard, which she had a Cornell engineering student and stone mason construct.

Built as part of the “Small House Movement,” these compact single-family homes had a simple layout—usually consisting of just two or three bedrooms, one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room on a single level. Newspapers and magazines published plans for small homes that could be built quickly and affordably with standardized materials.

Cornell to his sister Eunice and her husband Charles Taylor in 1919 is the story of what we know today as the Warren Real Estate building (with Tompkins Financial Corporation as its current tenant) at Community Corners. It was originally the farmhouse of the Kline family. Philip (1781-1874) and Elizabeth Winters (1787-1854) Kline migrated from New Jersey to Tompkins County by 1817. In that year they purchased 42.67 acres in Military Lot 90 from John Sharpe. After Benjamin Cradit’s death in 1823, the Klines bought part of the Cradit lands north of their original lot. The red brick Kline farmhouse was built on the former Cradit lands.
 
Eunice and Charles acquired the Kline farmhouse with the purchase of the Manning Farm from brother Franklin. They bought cows and ran a dairy business, which was not a great success. Widowed and without funds, Eunice was cared for by the farm manager and his wife. She died in 1942; the house was inhabited by a series of residents, thereby acquiring its infamous name, ""Bedbug House."" A cement garden, called ""The Mall"" was built in 1928 for the Taylors. Some of us may remember the house as the Peggy Cornwall women's clothing shop before Warren Real Estate moved in and accomplished renovations to the Federal style facade.

Dorothy's sister and brother-in-law, Eunice C. and Charles Taylor, lived next door at 830 Hanshaw. The home featured a slate roof, a chandelier or two from New York City's Hotel Martinique, a picket fence imported from France, fine ironwork hinges and handles on the doors and windows, a greenhouse, and a charming sun dial on the outside wall. The house changed hands many times after Dorothy lost her money in the Great Depression.
 
 In 1969 the Village purchased the house from the adjacent Village Green Shopping Center, naming it after Cornell professor and former Village mayor Frederick Marcham (112 Oak Hill Road), who served from 1956 to 1987.

Designed to serve the daily retail needs of Cayuga Heights residents, it continues to be the only shopping center at the hub of any neighborhood in Ithaca.
 
 Incorporated in 1946 by Walter C. Heasley, Jr., Gerald A. Hill, Henry J. Shirey, and Charles E. Treman, Jr., it was an outgrowth of Newman and Blood's original planning for small shops that would be within walking distance of villagers' homes. As such, its future is important and receives attention in the Village Comprehensive Plan. 
 
 In the 1950s, John Kangas owned the Corners Barber Shop (which still welcomes customers today), and Sophia Brand owned the Corners Beauty Shop. Today the Corners hosts businesses representative of today's tastes, such as Island Health and Fitness gym. 
 
 It is also said that Vladimir Nabokov spent time at Corners Community Center and even included it as a setting in his book, Pale Fire.
